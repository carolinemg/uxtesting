#The Process

To start developing the solution, the first step was understand the proposal and the content that will be displayed. As the layout was already given to me ( bootstrap and the RS Station header), I didn't need to struggle with visual interface, cause it was pratically ready. My worrys were to reproduce the visual the most I could to be look like the original one.

At the same time I was sketching the content the way I understand it will be better to the reading, I was preparing the environment for the application. I prepared it twice, the first time using a Mac, then I had to start it again in my home PC. :D 

After finished the handmade wireframes, I was able to start coding everything. My intent was focus on the reading experience, and get a clean visual of the content, with some discrete and attractive visual elements and interactions that keeps the reader flow. 

Coding HTML and Less is the easier part. Then get everything done for deployment, was the real struggle that took my evening to get ready in Windows and ready to be send to the Cloud. 

The process was quite simple, I took the Content First approach this time, and I think it is the rigt choice in cases like that. 

So now itÂ´s done! Hope you like it!
